# Description
A simple game where the player needs to manage a vegetable plantation.
This project was a technical test of a job interview that lasted 3 days.

Here is the subject:

```
The goal of this exercise is to code a small game where the goal is to manage his vegetable garden. 
The player must be able to take care of his vegetables, make them grow, harvest them, store them. Here are the constraints: 
- Game in third person, the player must be able to move within his vegetable garden
- Be able to plant, grow, harvest and store your vegetables
- Be able to keep your progress from one game to another (save)
- The game must use UE4 version 4.26 or 4.27

These are the only constraints. You are free to use what you want (on UE4 of course) to achieve this (BP, c++, plugins,...).
Feel free to add features if you have time (watering systems, animals to feed, recipes to cook, ...etc).

I will be particularly attentive to the clarity of the code and the architecture of the project.

Important: 
I would not consider the visual of the game at all. If your pumpkins are spheres and your carrots are cubes that's fine.
